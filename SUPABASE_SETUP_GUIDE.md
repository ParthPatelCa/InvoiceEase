```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here

SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
```

## 5. Testing Your Setup

### Test Authentication
1. Go to your app's `/auth/signup` page
2. Create a test account
3. Check that:
   - User is created in **Authentication** > **Users**
   - Organization is auto-created in your database
   - Email confirmation works (if enabled)

### Test Storage
1. Go to your app's `/dashboard` page
2. Upload a PDF file
3. Check that:
   - File appears in **Storage** > **invoices** bucket
   - File is in a user-specific folder (uploads/user-id/...)
   - Invoice record is created in database

### Test RLS
1. Try accessing another user's data
2. Verify that RLS blocks unauthorized access
3. Check that users can only see their own invoices

## 6. Production Checklist

Before going live, ensure:
- [ ] Email confirmations are enabled
- [ ] Site URL is set to your production domain
- [ ] Storage bucket is configured with proper size limits
- [ ] RLS policies are working correctly
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Vercel

## 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Monitor storage usage in **Settings** > **Usage**

- Review database performance in **Database** > **Logs**
- Monitor API usage and quotas

### Backup Strategy
- Enable automatic backups in **Settings** > **Database**
- Consider exporting schema changes for version control
- Monitor storage costs as file uploads increase

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "User not authenticated" errors
- Check that JWT tokens are being passed correctly
- Verify auth headers in API calls
- Ensure RLS policies allow the operation

### Storage upload failures
- Check file size limits (20MB max)
