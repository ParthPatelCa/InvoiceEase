# InvoiceEase: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Release Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a strategic Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release plan for InvoiceEase, a web application designed to convert PDF invoices into structured CSV files. The primary objective of this MVP is to deliver a simple, reliable tool that addresses the core need of freelancers and small businesses to automate invoice data entry, thereby reducing manual effort and errors. This plan focuses on a lean set of features to achieve rapid deployment, gather essential user feedback, and validate the core value proposition.

## 2. Project Overview

InvoiceEase is an MVP web application that streamlines the process of converting PDF invoices into CSV format, ready for import into accounting software. It is built with a modern tech stack, including Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and leverages Next.js API Routes with Supabase for the backend, database (PostgreSQL), storage, and authentication.

## 3. MVP Philosophy and Principles

Our MVP strategy for InvoiceEase is rooted in the following principles:

• **Simplicity and Reliability**: Deliver a straightforward, highly functional solution for PDF to CSV conversion, ensuring accuracy and ease of use.

• **Speed to Value**: Get the core functionality into users' hands quickly to solve an immediate pain point.

• **User-Centric Iteration**: Prioritize gathering feedback from early adopters to inform and validate future feature development.

• **Cost-Effectiveness**: Minimize initial development and operational costs by focusing on essential features.

• **Scalable Foundation**: Build upon a robust and scalable tech stack (Next.js, Supabase) that can support future growth and advanced features.

## 4. Proposed MVP Features (Include)

Based on the PRD.md and the current status of the repository, the following features are confirmed for inclusion in the initial MVP release. These features represent the absolute core functionality required to deliver value to the target user.

### 4.1. Core Conversion Workflow

• **User Authentication**: Secure email-based signup and login via Supabase Auth.

• **PDF Upload**: A user-friendly drag-and-drop interface for uploading single PDF invoices (up to 20 pages).

• **Mock Invoice Processing**: Initial processing will use mocked data extraction to demonstrate the flow from PDF upload to CSV generation. This simulates the OCR and data parsing without full integration of a complex OCR engine in the MVP.

• **CSV Export**: Generation of a clean, standardized CSV file with a fixed schema, containing extracted invoice data.

• **Download Functionality**: Ability for users to download their processed CSV files, with availability for seven days.

• **Real-time Status Updates**: Visual indicators and notifications to keep users informed about the processing status of their invoices.

### 4.2. Monetization and User Management

• **Free Tier**: A functional free tier allowing users to process up to five pages per month.

• **Single Paid Plan**: Implementation of a single paid subscription plan that increases the page limit.

• **Stripe Checkout and Customer Portal**: Integration with Stripe for secure payment processing and a customer portal for managing subscriptions.

### 4.3. User Experience and Analytics

• **Beautiful Landing Page**: A professional and clear landing page to communicate the value proposition.

• **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is fully functional and visually appealing across desktop and mobile devices.

• **Basic Product Analytics**: Tracking of key metrics such as time to first conversion and successful parse rates to understand user engagement and identify bottlenecks.

• **Error Tracking**: Basic error logging to identify and address critical issues.

## 5. Features to Exclude from MVP

The PRD.md explicitly defines features out of scope for v1 (MVP). These exclusions are critical for maintaining a focused MVP and achieving a rapid launch. These features will be considered for future iterations based on user feedback and market demand.

• **Full Vendor Specific Templates**: The MVP will not support specific templates for various banks or ERP systems. The focus is on a generic extraction.

• **Bulk Multi-file Drag and Drop**: Users will upload one PDF at a time.

• **API for Programmatic Ingestion**: No public API will be available for automated invoice ingestion in the MVP.

• **Accounting Integrations**: Direct integrations with external accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero) are deferred.

• **Team Seats and Permissions**: Multi-user accounts, roles, and permissions are not part of the MVP.
