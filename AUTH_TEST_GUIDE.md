# 🔒 Authentication Test Guide

## Summary of Fixes Applied

We've implemented comprehensive fixes for the Supabase authentication flow with Next.js 15:

### 1. **Updated Supabase Client Configuration** (`lib/supabase.ts`)
- ✅ Added `autoRefreshToken: true` to handle token refresh automatically
- ✅ Added `persistSession: true` to maintain session across page reloads  
- ✅ Added `detectSessionInUrl: true` to handle auth callbacks properly

### 2. **Created Server-Side Supabase Client** (`lib/supabase-server.ts`)
- ✅ Implemented `createServerClient` from `@supabase/ssr` for Next.js 15 compatibility
- ✅ Proper cookie handling for server-side authentication operations
- ✅ Required for auth callback route and middleware

### 3. **Updated Auth Callback Route** (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- ✅ Now uses server-side Supabase client for proper SSR support
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging for debugging
- ✅ Proper redirect handling after successful authentication

### 4. **Updated Middleware** (`middleware.ts`)
- ✅ Integrated Supabase SSR client for proper session management
- ✅ Maintains session state across server-side operations
- ✅ Proper cookie handling for authentication persistence

## 🧪 Test Authentication Flow

### Step 1: Visit Landing Page
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ Should load without authentication errors
- ✅ Should show signup/login options

### Step 2: Create Account
1. Go to `/auth/signup`
2. Enter email and password
3. Submit form
4. **Expected:** Email confirmation sent message

### Step 3: Check Email Confirmation
1. Check your email for confirmation link
2. Click the confirmation link
3. **Expected:** Redirected to `/auth/callback` then to dashboard
4. **Previously failing:** "Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found"
5. **Now fixed:** Should authenticate successfully

### Step 4: Verify Dashboard Access
1. After confirmation, should be redirected to `/dashboard`
2. **Expected:** Authenticated dashboard view
3. **Check:** No authentication errors in browser console

### Step 5: Test Session Persistence
1. Refresh the page while on dashboard
2. **Expected:** Should remain authenticated
3. **Expected:** No token refresh errors

## 🐛 If Issues Persist

### Check Browser Console
Look for these specific errors:
- ❌ "Invalid Refresh Token: Refresh Token Not Found"
- ❌ "AuthApiError" messages
- ❌ Session/cookie related errors

### Check Network Tab
1. Open browser dev tools → Network
2. During auth callback, check for:
   - ✅ Successful POST to `/auth/callback`
   - ✅ Proper redirect responses (302/200)
   - ❌ Any 4xx/5xx errors

### Verify Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

## 🎯 Next Steps After Auth Works

Once authentication is working properly:

### Phase 1 Core Implementation (Following MVP Release Plan)
1. **Mock Invoice Processing Pipeline**
   - File upload endpoint
   - Mock processing logic
   - CSV generation

2. **Complete Upload/Download Flow**
   - User uploads spreadsheet
   - System processes (mock for now)
   - User downloads CSV invoices

3. **Basic Dashboard Features**
   - Upload history
   - Download status
   - Simple usage metrics

### Expected Outcome
With authentication fixed, users should be able to:
- ✅ Sign up and confirm email without errors
- ✅ Access dashboard after authentication
- ✅ Maintain session across page refreshes
- ✅ Proceed to file upload/processing features

## 🔧 Technical Details

The core issue was that Next.js 15 requires specific Supabase SSR configuration:

**Problem:** Client-side Supabase client couldn't handle auth callbacks properly in server environment

**Solution:** Created separate server-side client with proper cookie handling for SSR operations

**Key Change:** Using `@supabase/ssr` package's `createServerClient` for server-side auth operations while maintaining `createBrowserClient` for client-side interactions.

This ensures proper session management across both client and server environments in Next.js 15's App Router.
